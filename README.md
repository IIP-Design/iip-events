# IIP Events

This plugin adds an IIP Events custom post type to a WordPress site. Once activated, users can add events with a variety of information including:

- Event title
- Event promotional image
- Event description and excerpt
- Event date and time (with multi-day and "to be announced" options)
- Flexible event details fields for custom inputs
- Speaker information (name, title, bio, image)
- Promotional material links and file uploads
- Contact information.

This information will then be displayed on the front end in a event post and made available in the site's API by means of a custom REST endpoint.
