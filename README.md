# IIP Events

This plugin contains a `iip-events.php`, which registers plugin and begins its execution. Additionally, there is an admin class (`admin/class-iip-events-admin.php`) where all admin hooks are registered and the frontend class (`public/class-iip-events-public.php`) where all public hooks are registered. The includes directory contains the main plugin class (`include/class-iip-events.php`), which defines the core functionality of the plugin and the loader file (`include/class-iip-events-loader.php`), which feeds the admin and public hooks in from their respective classes into the main class file.

The `admin` directory also includes everything necessary to build a React app located in the `js`. The entry point for this admin app is `src/index.js` and all code added to the admin app should reside in the `src` directory. The package also includes webpack to allow for running development server and bundling the admin code into a production build. To run the dev server navigate to the `admin/js` directory and run `npm run start`. This will run the server on localhost port 8080. To run a production build of the admin section run the command `npm run build` from the `admin/js` directory. This will create a production bundle that will be saved in the `dist` directory.
